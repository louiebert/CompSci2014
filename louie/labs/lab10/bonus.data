THE SITH CODE, AS WRITTEN BY SORZUS SYN AND TAUGHT BY DARTH BANE:

PEACE IS A LIE, THERE IS ONLY PASSION.
THROUGH PASSION, I GAIN STRENGTH.
THROUGH STRENGTH, I GAIN POWER.
THROUGH POWER, I GAIN VICTORY.
THROUGH VICTORY, MY CHAINS ARE BROKEN.
THE FORCE SHALL FREE ME.

"A SINGLE, UNIFYING CODE CAN BE DERIVED FROM THE SITH PHILOSOPHY.
THE JEDI HAVE A CODE, AND WE EXILES KNOW IT WELL. BUT WE ALSO KNOW
IT IS FULL OF INADEQUACIES AND HALF-TRUTHS."
-SORZUS SYN

"THE TENETS OF THE SITH ARE MORE THAN JUST WORDS TO BE MEMORIZED.
LEARN THEM, UNDERSTAND THEM. THEY WILL LEAD YOU TO THE TRUE POWER
OF THE FORCE; THE POWER OF THE DARK SIDE."
-QORDIS

PEACE IS A LIE, THERE IS ONLY PASSION

"CONFLICT FORCES ONE TO BETTER ONESELF. IT FORCES CHANGE, GROWTH,
ADAPTION, EVOLUTIONZ OR DEATH."
-YUTHURA BAN

THROUGH PASSION, I GAIN STRENGTH.

"IT IS OUR GOAL TO BE STRONGER, TO ACHIEVE OUR POTENTIAL AND NOT
REST UPON OUR LAURELS. WE ARE THE SEEKERS, NOT THE SHEPHERDS."
-YUTHURA BAN

THROUGH STRENGTH, I GAIN POWER

"WITHOUT STRIFE, THE VICTORY HAS NO MEANING. WITHOUT STRIFE, ONE
DOES NOT ADVANCE. WITHOUT STRIFE, THERE IS ONLY STAGNATION."
-YUTHURA BAN

THROUGH VICTORY, MY CHAINS ARE BROKEN

"ONE WHO HAS FREED THEMSELVES FROM ALL RESTRICTIONS HAS REACHED
PERFECTIONZ THEIR POTENTIAL FULFILLED. PERFECT STRENGTH, PERFECT
POWER, PERFECT DESTINY."
-YUTHURA BAN
