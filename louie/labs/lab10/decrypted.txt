GENERAL DODONNA: THE BATTLE STATION IS HEAVILY SHIELDED AND CARRIES A FIREPOWER GREATER THAN HALF THE STAR FLEET. ITS DEFENSES ARE DESIGNED AROUND A DIRECT, LARGE-SCALE ASSAULT. A SMALL ONE-MAN FIGHTER SHOULD BE ABLE TO PENETRATE THE OUTER DEFENSE. GOLD LEADER: PARDON ME FOR ASKING, SIR, BUT WHAT GOOD ARE SNUB FIGHTERS GOING TO BE AGAINST THAT? GENERAL DODONNA: WELL, THE EMPIRE DOESN'T CONSIDER A SMALL ONE-MAN FIGHTER TO BE ANY THREAT, OR THEY'D HAVE A TIGHTER DEFENSE. AN ANALYSIS OF THE PLANS PROVIDED BY PRINCESS LEIA HAS DEMONSTRATED A WEAKNESS IN THE BATTLE STATION. BUT THE APPROACH WILL NOT BE EASY. YOU ARE REQUIRED TO MANEUVER STRAIGHT DOWN THIS TRENCH AND SKIM THE SURFACE TO THIS POINT. THE TARGET AREA IS ONLY TWO METERS WIDE. IT'S A SMALL THERMAL EXHAUST PORT, RIGHT BELOW THE MAIN PORT. THE SHAFT LEADS DIRECTLY TO THE REACTOR SYSTEM. A PRECISE HIT WILL START A CHAIN REACTION WHICH SHOULD DESTROY THE STATION. ONLY A PRECISE HIT WILL SET OFF A CHAIN REACTION. THE SHAFT IS RAY-SHIELDED, SO YOU'LL HAVE TO USE PROTON TORPEDOES. WEDGE ANTILLES (RED 2): THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE! EVEN FOR A COMPUTER. LUKE: IT'S NOT IMPOSSIBLE. I USED TO BULLSEYE WOMP RATS IN MY T-16 BACK HOME, THEY'RE NOT MUCH BIGGER THAN TWO METERS. GENERAL DODONNA: THEN MAN YOUR SHIPS. AND MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- GENERAL TAGGE: WHAT OF THE REBELLION? IF THE REBELS HAVE OBTAINED A COMPLETE TECHNICAL READING OF THIS STATION, IT IS POSSIBLE, HOWEVER UNLIKELY, THEY MIGHT FIND A WEAKNESS AND EXPLOIT IT. DARTH VADER: THE PLANS YOU REFER TO WILL SOON BE BACK IN OUR HANDS. ADMIRAL MOTTI: ANY ATTACK MADE BY THE REBELS AGAINST THIS STATION WOULD BE A USELESS GESTURE, NO MATTER WHAT TECHNICAL DATA THEY HAVE OBTAINED. THIS STATION IS NOW THE ULTIMATE POWER IN THE UNIVERSE! I SUGGEST WE USE IT! DARTH VADER: DON'T BE TOO PROUD OF THIS TECHNOLOGICAL TERROR YOU'VE CONSTRUCTED. THE ABILITY TO DESTROY A PLANET IS INSIGNIFICANT NEXT TO THE POWER OF THE FORCE. ADMIRAL MOTTI: DON'T TRY TO FRIGHTEN US WITH YOUR SORCERER'S WAYS, LORD VADER. YOUR SAD DEVOTION TO THAT ANCIENT JEDI RELIGION HAS NOT HELPED YOU CONJURE UP THE STOLEN DATA TAPES, OR GIVEN YOU ENOUGH CLAIRVOYANCE TO FIND THE REBELS' HIDDEN FORTRESS... [VADER MAKES A PINCHING MOTION AND MOTTI STARTS CHOKING] DARTH VADER: I FIND YOUR LACK OF FAITH DISTURBING.
